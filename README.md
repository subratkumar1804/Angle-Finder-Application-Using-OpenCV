# Angle-Finder-Application-Using-OpenCV

The Angle Finder OpenCV Python was developed using Python OpenCV, In this Python Project With Source Code we will learn on How To Create The Project Using OpenCV Python. We will first define two lines using mouse clicks and then find the angle between these lines using simple mathematics.

OpenCV is short for Open Source Computer Vision. Intuitively by the name, it is an open-source Computer Vision and Machine Learning library. This library is capable of processing real-time image and video while also boasting analytical capabilities. It supports the Deep Learning frameworks.

To start executing Angle Finder, make sure that you have installed Python 3.9 and PyCharm in your computer.

Steps to execute:

1. Open PyCharm IDE
2. Install required modules using pip install command
3. Open Terminal in PyCharm IDE
4. Change the the path to required Directory.
5. Run the file using command python angleFinder.py
